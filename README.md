Directory structure is as follows:


weather-manager/
├── weather-data.txt       (contains weather data to be processed)
└── src/
    └── weather.clj   (contains the code)

To run the application, navigate to the weather-manager directory, and please make sure the weather-data.txt file is in the same directory.

Open the terminal and navigate to the weather-manager folder (if you're not already there):

cd weather-manager

Then, run the application using Leiningen:

lein run

Also :save-reports-> "Saving the changes is optional and this menu option can be treated as exit only."

Therefore, left save-reports() as the original code(in zip file) as.
